The Advanced Media Workflow Association exists to help media businesses to improve efficiencies,
increase agility and drive down costs.  Our worldwide membership comprises electronic media companies,
their suppliers plus individual technology specialists and developers.

The AMWA develops specifications and technologies to facilitate the deployment and operation of efficient media workflows.
These include the Application Specifications for use of MXF, for example AS-11 for delivery of finished media files,
and the Networked Media Open Specifications (NMOS) for interoperable control and monitoring of IP-based media devices.
