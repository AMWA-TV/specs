# About AMWA Specifications

The AMWA develops specifications and technologies to facilitate the deployment and operation of efficient media workflows. These include:

- Application Specifications, for example the [MXF AS-11 Contribution File Formats](https://www.amwa.tv/as-11)
- Data Model Specifications, for example the [AAF Object Model](https://e6cfd1ba-033d-44fd-8f16-0027ec40a7b2.filesusr.com/ugd/f66d69_cea9a4c10d834b819fcd3c5c66974dbb.pdf)
- Interface Specifications, for example the [NMOS APIs](/nmos)
- Best Current Practices, for example the [NMOS Security Recommendations](/bcp-003)

To make sure that projects are clearly defined, adequately resourced and successful, we have a process to carefully manage proposals from start to finish. We welcome all new ideas to advance workflows. The AMWA Specification Process document (see link below) provides information on how AMWA projects are started, the different types of AMWA Specifications, and the different levels of AMWA Specifications
