# About AMWA Specifications

The AMWA develops specifications and technologies to facilitate the deployment and operation of efficient media workflows. These include:

- Application Specifications, such as the [MXF AS-11 contribution file formats](https://www.amwa.tv/as-11)
- Data Model Specifications, such as the [AAF Object Model](https://e6cfd1ba-033d-44fd-8f16-0027ec40a7b2.filesusr.com/ugd/f66d69_cea9a4c10d834b819fcd3c5c66974dbb.pdf)
- Interface Specifications, such as the [NMOS APIs](/nmos)
- Best Current Practices

To make sure that projects are clearly defined, adequately resourced and successful, we have a process to carefully manage proposals from start to finish. We welcome all new ideas to advance workflows. The AMWA Specification Process document (see link below) provides information on how AMWA projects are started, the different types of AMWA Specifications, and the different levels of AMWA Specifications
